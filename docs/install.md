# Installing Enclaver

Enclaver is released on GitHub: https://github.com/edgebitio/enclaver/releases

Binary releases exist for Linux and MacOS platforms, and x86 and Arm architectures.

`enclaver build` and other commands can be executed on any platform and architecture.

`enclaver run` only supports Linux/x86 based enclaves at this time, but Linux/Arm support is very close, tracked by [issue #97](https://github.com/edgebitio/enclaver/issues/97)

## Getting Started
